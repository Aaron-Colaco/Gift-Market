<h1>Gift Market by Aaron Colaco</h1>

<p>This is a fully-fledged gift shop developed entirely by me using ASP.NET MVC. The application features integrated Stripe payment gateway, comprehensive add-to-cart functionality, user registration and login capabilities, as well as an admin panel for managing sales data and orders. Additionally, my application supports automatic order updated emails through intergation of the MailKit API. It is optimized for both web and mobile devices, and has an aesthetically pleasing and user-friednly design.</p>

<p>Developed using C#, ASP.NET MVC .NET 8, using Entity Framework Core(ORM), as well as LINQ, SQL, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.</p>
I invested a considerable amount of time and effort into my first ASP.NET MVC project. I successfully familiarized myself with the MVC architecture and the ASP.NET Core framework, as well as the LINQ language. I also enhanced my skills in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Developing this project significantly expanded my knowledge in object-oriented programming, database concepts, and program logic. I am particularly proud of implementing a fully functional payment system and robust add-to-cart feature.</p>
